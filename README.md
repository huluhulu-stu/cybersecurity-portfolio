# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me 
I am HUXINYA, a dedicated student currently enrolled in the **WQE7001 Cyber Security** course. 
I have a strong passion for understanding network architectures and implementing security measures.

## Technical Skills
**Network Simulation**: GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer.
**Security Protocols**: IPv4 Access Control Lists (ACLs), VLAN Security.
**Routing & Switching**: Layer 3 Switching, Inter-VLAN Routing, OSPF.
**Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux (Basic).

## Project Experience 
### [ Project 1: Enterprise Network Simulation (GNS3) ]
**Objective**: To design and implement a complex enterprise network topology.
**Tools**: GNS3, Cisco IOS.

### [Project 2: Network Traffic Control via IPv4 ACL Implementation]
**Objective**: To secure sensitive network segments by restricting unauthorized access using Access Control Lists.
**Tools Used**: Cisco Packet Tracer.
**Methodology**: 
    Configured Standard and Extended IPv4 ACLs to filter traffic.
    Implemented Inter-VLAN routing to manage data flow.
**Outcomes**: Successfully restricted unauthorized access and optimized network security.

## Learning Journey
Throughout this course, I have transitioned from designing theoretical network topologies to implementing security configurations on both virtual and physical environments.
**The Shift from Simulation to Reality**: While I gained proficiency in building topologies via GNS3 and Packet Tracer, I encountered unexpected challenges when working with physical hardware. Managing physical cabling, identifying hardware interface mismatches, and dealing with real-time device console responses proved to be much more complex than the "perfect" conditions of a simulator.
**Key Challenges**: 
    Logical complexity of Extended IPv4 ACLs in a multi-VLAN environment.
    Troubleshooting physical connectivity issues that do not exist in virtual simulations.
    Ensuring routing stability (OSPF) when physical links experience latency or hardware constraints.
**Improvement Plan**: To bridge this gap, I plan to spend more time in the hardware lab to synchronize my simulation logic with real-world deployments and study advanced network troubleshooting methodologies.

## Career Objective
My goal is to become a professional Cybersecurity Engineer, focusing on network defense and infrastructure security.
