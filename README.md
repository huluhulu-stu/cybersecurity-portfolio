# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me 
I am HUXINYA, a dedicated student currently enrolled in the **WQE7001 Cyber Security** course. 
I have a strong passion for understanding network architectures and implementing security measures.

## Technical Skills
  **Network Simulation**: GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer 
  **Security Protocols**: IPv4 Access Control Lists (ACLs), VLAN Security
  **Routing & Switching**: Layer 3 Switching, Inter-VLAN Routing 

## Project Experience 
### Project 1: Enterprise Network Simulation (GNS3) 
  **Objective**: To design and implement a complex enterprise network topology.
  **Tools**: GNS3, Cisco IOS.

## Technical Skills
**Network Simulation**: GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer.
**Security Protocols**: IPv4 Access Control Lists (ACLs), VLAN Security.
**Routing & Switching**: Layer 3 Switching, Inter-VLAN Routing, OSPF.
**Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux (Basic).

### Project 2: Network Traffic Control via IPv4 ACL Implementation
**Objective**: To secure sensitive network segments by restricting unauthorized access using Access Control Lists.
**Tools Used**: Cisco Packet Tracer.
**Methodology**: 
    Configured Standard and Extended IPv4 ACLs to filter traffic.
    Implemented Inter-VLAN routing to manage data flow.
**Outcomes**: Successfully restricted unauthorized access and optimized network security.

## Learning Journey
Through this course, I have significantly improved my hands-on skills in network simulation and security configuration. 
**Challenges**: I found the logic behind Extended ACL rules and troubleshooting complex OSPF routing in GNS3 to be challenging.
**Improvement Plan**: I plan to overcome these by conducting more lab practices and studying official Cisco documentation to deepen my understanding.
